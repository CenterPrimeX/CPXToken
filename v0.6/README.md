# CPX Token Contracts
The CPX token is an [EIP20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md) token with additional [ERC677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677) and [ERC865](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/865) functionality.
The total supply of the token is 1,000,000,000, and each token is divisible up to 18 decimal places.
To prevent accidental burns, the token does not allow transfers to the contract itself and to 0x0.
Security audit for v0.6 version of the contracts is available here.
