## CPX Token Use

The CenterPrime platform's native digital encryption security utility token is designed to serve as an important role in the De-Fi Multi-Layer Perceptron ecosystem. 
The De-Fi Multi-LayerPerceptron Protocol expressed an asset that combines a bundle of custodial and non-custodial assets and a combination of each functional layer as a neuron asset (synthetic asset).

CPX tokens are used only as the platform's default utility token and are only provided as a convenient and secure payment method for participants interacting with the De-Fi Multi-Layer Perceptron neuron asset. CPX tokens do not in any way represent any payment or debt redemption for goods or services of other chains other than the De-Fi Multi-Layer Perceptron, the operation of the CenterPrime Foundation, and the equity, participation, rights, ownership, or interest in affiliates, enterprises, other enterprises or businesses. CPX Token does not give token holders any promises of fees, dividends, profits, profits, or return on investment, and has no intention to form securities in Singapore or relevant jurisdiction. CPX tokens are only available on the CenterPrime platform, and ownership of CPX tokens has no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use CPX tokens as means to enable use and interaction within the CenterPrime platform.

In addition, CPX tokens serve as an economic incentive consumed to encourage users to contribute and maintain the De-Fi Multi-Layer Perceptron ecosystem on the CenterPrime platform, creating a win-win system in which all participants are fairly rewarded for their efforts. CPX tokens are used to pay gas fees generated when creating De-Fi Multi-Layer Perceptron synthetic asset and synthetic asset group wallets and will continue to be used to pay gas for various utilities on the CenterPrime platform.

### ○ Oracle Perceptron Neuron Asset Liquidity Pool Creation

A pool that can store various neuron assets (synthetic assets) is required to connect the custodial assets and non-custodial assets. In particular, the financial sector is conducting continuous research on digital assets, and some financial institutions are on the verge of actual introduction, and what is required in this global trend is a pool that can entrust various assets. CPX tokens will be used by various financial institutions or enterprises to create pools to store neuron assets.

### ○ Oracle Perceptron Wallet Creation

The Oracle Perceptron Wallet is a wallet that can hold custodial assets, non-custodial assets, and neuron assets. It contains essential functions for building the De-Fi ecosystem, conducting transactions between digital assets and various assets that many countries are planning to implement, and for enterprises, enterprises, and individual, and individual and individual to trade through P2P. The Oracle Perceptron Wallet will accommodate the scalability and diversity of open banking protocols and De-Fi protocols within a reliable smart contract solution structure and will be a medium for connecting the real economy and the De-Fi economy. CPX tokens will be used for storage, exchange, payment and transaction in the Oracle Perceptron wallets and will only be used for various utility gas payments. The Oracle Perceptron Wallet allows users to use most of the services used in the real economy through a variety of assets.

### ○ Oracle Perceptron Neural Network Enterprise Registration

On the Center Prime platform that supports transactions between various assets, there are chains of various countries, financial institutions, and enterprises that provide content. Chains of each country, financial institution, and enterprise provide high-quality financial and content data to the CenterPrime ecosystem and attract users who use various assets as customers. CPX token is a utility token that will be used as a gas fee when the data enterprise first registers to provide data to the ecosystem. It also provides a platform for and realizes the conversion of various data generated in the private chain, public chain, and node chain into real valuable data and realizes it.
