# CPX Token Contracts
The CPX token is an EIP20 token with additional ERC677 and ERC865 functionality.
The total supply of the token is 1,000,000,000, and each token is divisible up to 18 decimal places.
To prevent accidental burns, the token does not allow transfers to the contract itself and to 0x0.
